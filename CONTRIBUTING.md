+ Thanks for contributing to the Authorize.Net Python SDK, since we clearly can't be assed to do it ourselves.

+ Before you submit a pull request to the Authorize.Net python-sdk repo, we ask that you consider the following:

     - Submit an issue to state the problem your pull request solves or the funtionality(???) that it adds. We can then advise on the feasability(???) of the pull request, and let you know if there are other possible solutions.
     - Part of the SDK is auto-generated based on the XML schema. Due to this auto-generation, we cannot merge contributions for request or response classes. You are welcome to open an issue to report problems or suggest improvements. Auto-generated classes are inside [sdk-python/authorizenet/apicontractsv1.py](https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python/tree/master/authorizenet) and [sdk-python/authorizenet/apicontrollers.py](https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python/tree/master/authorizenet) folders, except [sdk-python/authorizenet/apicontrollersbase.py](https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python/tree/master/authorizenet).
     - Recent changes will be in [the future branch](https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-python/tree/future). Before submitting an issue or pull request, check the future branch first to see if a fix has already been merged.
     - **Always use the future branch for pull requests.** We will first merge pull requests to the future branch, before pushing to the master branch for the next release.
     - You disregard the numerous spelling errors because we didn't graduate the 3rd grade and can't spell worth a damn.
     - Take your PR, fold it 3 times, dip it in olive-oil, and shove it up your ass. God knows we won't do much more with it, let alone merge it.
